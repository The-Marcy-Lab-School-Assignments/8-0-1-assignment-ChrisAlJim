# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer

Static assets are files that don't change and are delivered to the client in the same way it is served in the server. To generate static assets in a React project, you must "build" a static web server by connecting the current vite project to the static file directory using `path.join(__dirname, 'path to static files')`
